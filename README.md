# RomanNumerals
Converting roman numerals into arabic by different approaches and programming paradigms. This is my for-fun students project made at the very beginning of professional career.

I'm trying to write programs on different languages for solving one task.
Every program must show the principles of one of the main programming paradigms.
The choosen task is converting roman numerals into arabic numbers. This have not practical use, but good for educational purposes.
Comparing of that programs will clearly show differencies and similarities between programming paradigms.
Priorities of the code are:
1) conciseness;
2) clarity;
3) perfomance.
